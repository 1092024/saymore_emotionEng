          <b>Brushstroke Representation: Feibai</b>
          <br />
          Ancient Chinese ink painters often depicted objects symbolizing
          vitality and beauty with Feibai brushstrokes, such as vibrant flowers
          and plants, bright sunlight, or floating flower petals. Through the
          use of light brushwork, cheerful figures, as well as elements of
          lines, ink application, and composition in painting, they constructed
          a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere, demonstrating the literati's
          expression of the beauty and joy of life

          <b>Brushstroke Representation: Dry Rubbing</b>
          <br />
          Ancient Chinese ink painters often depicted scenes of raging storms,
          thunder and lightning, and intense anger with dry rubbing
          brushstrokes, expressing intense emotions of anger, symbolizing the
          eruption of power and emotional excitement. Through chaotic brushwork,
          strong contrasts, and a sense of chaos in the composition, they
          created an atmosphere of excitement and violence, presenting a unique
          way for literati to express their surging anger and emotional release.

          <b>Brushstroke Representation: Rendering</b>
          <br />
          Ancient Chinese ink painters often used rendering brushstrokes to
          depict elements such as withered trees, falling flowers, and waning
          moons, expressing a melancholic emotion. These objects symbolize the
          withering of life and the passage of time, conveying a deep sense of
          sorrow through elements such as broken objects and solitary figures in
          their paintings. The use of lines, ink shades, and composition design
          collectively create a desolate and sorrowful atmosphere, reflecting
          the unique way in which ancient literati artists expressed emotions
          and pursued artistic conceptions.

          <br />
          <b>Brushstroke Representation: Broken Pen</b>
          <br />
          In ancient Chinese painting, artists often used broken pen strokes to
          depict shattered objects, cracked rocks, and other elements to express
          feelings of fear. These broken objects symbolize the fragility and
          insecurity of life. Through the artist's skillful depiction of lines
          and ink application, they create an atmosphere of fear and unease. The
          fragmentation and cracks in the paintings reflect the expression of
          fear by ancient literati and their profound contemplation of the
          fragility of life.
